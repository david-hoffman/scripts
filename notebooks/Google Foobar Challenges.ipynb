    "Can we save them? Beta Rabbit is trying to break into a lab that contains the only known zombie cure - but there's an obstacle. The door will only open if a challenge is solved correctly. The future of the zombified rabbit population is at stake, so Beta reads the challenge: There is a scale with an object on the left-hand side, whose mass is given in some number of units. Predictably, the task is to balance the two sides. But there is a catch: You only have this peculiar weight set, having masses 1, 3, 9, 27, ... units. That is, one for each power of 3. Being a brilliant mathematician, Beta Rabbit quickly discovers that any number of units of mass can be balanced exactly using this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help Beta get into the room, write a method called answer(x), which outputs a list of strings representing where the weights should be placed, in order for the two sides to be balanced, assuming that weight on the left has mass x units.\n",

    "The first element of the output list should correspond to the 1-unit weight, the second element to the 3-unit weight, and so on. Each string is one of: \n",

    "\"R\" : put weight on right-hand side \n",

    "================\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Boolean continues to perform diabolical studies on your fellow rabbit kin, and not all of it is taking place in the lab. Reports say the mad doctor has his eye on infecting a rabbit in a local village with a virus that transforms rabbits into zombits (zombie-rabbits)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Boolean is confident in the virus's ability to spread, and he will only infect a single rabbit. Unfortunately, you and your fellow resistance agents have no idea which rabbit will be targeted. You've been asked to predict how the infection would spread if uncontained, so you decide to create a simulation experiment. In this simulation, the rabbit that Dr. Boolean will initially infect will be called \"Patient Z\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the lab experts have discovered that all rabbits contain a property they call \"Resistance\", which is capable of fighting against the infection. The virus has a particular \"Strength\" which Dr. Boolean needs to make at least as large as the rabbits' Resistance for it to infect them. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be provided with the following information:\n",
    "population = A 2D non-empty array of positive integers. (The dimensions of the array are not necessarily equal.) Each cell represents one rabbit, and the value of the cell represents that rabbit's Resistance. All cells contain a rabbit.\n",
    "x = The X-Coordinate (column) of \"Patient Z\" in the population array.\n",
    "y = The Y-Coordinate (row) of \"Patient Z\" in the population array.\n",
    "strength = A constant integer value representing the Strength of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the rules of the simulation: First, the virus will attempt to infect Patient Z. Patient Z will only be infected if the infection's Strength equals or exceeds Patient Z's Resistance. From then on, any infected rabbits will attempt to infect any uninfected neighbors (cells that are directly - not diagonally - adjacent in the array). They will succeed in infecting any neighbors with a Resistance lower than or equal to the infection's Strength. This will continue until no further infections are possible (i.e., every uninfected rabbit adjacent to an infected rabbit has a Resistance greater than the infection's Strength.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a function answer(population, x, y, strength), which outputs a copy of the input array representing the state of the population at the end of the simulation, in which any infected cells value has been replaced with -1.\n",
    "The Strength and Resistance values will be between 0 and 10000. The population grid will be at least 2x2 and no larger than 50x50. The x and y values will be valid indices in the population arrays, with numbering beginning from 0.\n",
